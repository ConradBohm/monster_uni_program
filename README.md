# Monsters Inc. University Program
This is a program that allows you to explore the data of a small monster university, and add some data to be 
used also.

## Working the Program
Starting up the program brings you to an option menu which you can explore by inputting numbers into the terminal
to choose the option you would like.

Each option of the first level menu brings you to a new sub-menu with further options based upon the initial option
you chose. 

### Student Section
Here you can:
- Search students in the database and have the data in their file be printed.
- List the names of all of the students in the database.
- Add a new skill to a particular student's profile.
- Add a new student entirely.

Each option has text explaining what needs to be done, and prompts when you need to input data or a selection
choice. The students created here can be used in other parts of the program, just like the pre-made student 
profiles.

### Rooms Section
This section would allow you to explore details of the different kinds of rooms at the University, and details
about each one. However, it is still under development and not operational yet.

### Workshop Section
This is where the information about the different courses offered by the University can be explored. You can
find a list of the courses, details on each one, and you can also add any students in the system to the 
class. However, you do not have the permissions to create a new workshop.

### Teachers Section
This section is very much the same as the Student section, except this time with the teachers instead. However,
the adding a teacher functionality is not there as it wasn't a required feature, and teachers are a lot more of
a fixed position compared to the quick turnover of students.

### Exit
Simply ends the program once you are finished.

## Data
This program comes with pre-packed data so it will work. Since you only have limited ability to add new data, 
and any new data inputted gets removed every time the program is restarted, it is useful to have some persistent
data so some isn't needed to be inputted every time.
